Release history

0.1.2	 18 Aug 2003	
	．Optimized chunked slicing of floats and longs e.g. v1 [slice]: used Altivec permutes, 39% faster.
	．Optimized chunked relational min, max e.g. (v1 == v2).min (): used Altivec predicates, 21% faster.
	．Optimized unchunked bool-valued min, max: 2.44x faster.
	．Now builds correctly with Project Builder 2.1 and December 2002 gcc 3.3 Updater.
	．Refactored entire term hierarchy for easier value type partial specialization.
	．Allocations are now exact instead of rounded up to Altivec alignment; algorithms adjusted to use scalar code on array tails.
	．Fixed bug where element access to a unary term could not compile e.g. sin (v1) [0].
	．Fixed bug where chunked min, max or sum of boolean could not compile.
