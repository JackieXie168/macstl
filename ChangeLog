Release history

0.1.5	3 Nov 2003	
	．Now builds with Xcode 1.0 [*CBe].
	．Fixed altivec functions not compiling in gcc 3.1: “tree_list not supported by dump_expr” [JLWi].
	．Reduced download size by removing build directories [ASt].
	．Fixed altivec abs ambiguity.
	．Fixed internal valarray #includes.
	．Fixed uninitialized_copy_n not compiling with non-random access iterators.

0.1.4	29 Sep 2003	
	．Added shift member to altivec class.
	．Enabled generated constants only for NDEBUG builds [HBe].
	．Renamed sl to operator<< and sra to operator>>.
	．Fixed 1,021 constants for correctness and efficiency [*HBe].
	．Fixed sqrt not compiling or returning incorrect results for CodeWarrior.
	．Fixed unary functions not inlining (0.1.3).
	．Fixed some binary operators not compiling for altivec boolean types (0.1.3).
	．Fixed namespace of min, max altivec functions.

0.1.3	25 Sep 2003	
	．Now builds with Metrowerks CodeWarrior 9.
	．Now builds with August 2003 gcc 3.3 Updater.
	．Added 65,566 generated Altivec constants, using optimal instruction sequences without memory loads [*HBe].
	．Added all intrinsic Altivec operators.
	．Added unit tests for operators and scalarizers against the builtin types [WTo].
	．Added doxygen comments to most public classes and some internal classes.
	．Added cshift member to altivec class.
	．Added pixel class.
	．Now works correctly as #included system headers:added include guards, fixed internal #lincludes.
	．Simplified term use of template template functors, used explicit enchunking of functors.
	．Removed libstdc++ dependencies: added destroy_n algorithm and identity functor, rewrote uninitialized_copy_n and copy_n, remapped type traits system.
	．Fixed terms including >> and << not compiling.
	．Fixed initial valarray fill not compiling if the type had a non-trivial destructor.
	．Fixed valarray of bool compiling incorrectly if sizeof (bool) != 4.
	．Fixed binder1st/2nd with differing argument types not compiling.
	．Fixed operator- of some term iterators not compiling.
	．Fixed incorrect value for chunked sum of char.

0.1.2	 18 Aug 2003	
	．Optimized chunked slicing of floats and longs e.g. v1 [slice]: used Altivec permutes, 39% faster.
	．Optimized chunked relational min, max e.g. (v1 == v2).min (): used Altivec predicates, 21% faster.
	．Optimized unchunked bool-valued min, max: 2.44x faster.
	．Now builds correctly with Project Builder 2.1 and December 2002 gcc 3.3 Updater.
	．Refactored entire term hierarchy for easier value type partial specialization.
	．Allocations are now exact instead of rounded up to Altivec alignment; algorithms adjusted to use scalar code on array tails.
	．Fixed bug where element access to a unary term could not compile e.g. sin (v1) [0].
	．Fixed bug where chunked min, max or sum of boolean could not compile.

0.1.1	 26 Jul 2003	
	．Fixed gcc 3.3 compile issues: stricter access control, in-class init of vector constant. [ACu]

0.1	 9 Jul 2003	
	．Initial release.
